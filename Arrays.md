## Array:
An array is a  special variable,which can hold more than one value at a time.
An array can hold many values under a single name,and we can access the values by refering to an index number.

### Creating an Array
Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

#### Syntax:
var array_name = [item1, item2, ...]; 

### Arrays are Objects:
1. Arrays are a special type of objects. The typeof operator in JavaScript returns "object" for arrays.
2. It stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. 
3. An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type.

#### Syntax
Use the following syntax to create an Array object.
var fruits = new Array( "apple", "orange", "mango" );

Arrays use numbers to access its "elements".

 In this example, person.firstName returns John:

### Array Object
Objects use names to access its "members".

#### Syntax:
var variable_name/array_name= {key1:value1, key2:value2, ...};
