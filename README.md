## What is the BOM in JavaScript?
The Browser Object Model (BOM) is used to interact with the browser.
The BOM is the Browser Object Model, which deals with browser components aside from the document, like history, location, navigator and screen (as well as some others that vary by browser).

## Window Object
The window object represents a window in browser. An object of window is created automatically by the browser.

Window is the object of browser, it is not the object of javascript. The javascript objects are string, array, date etc.
