## JavaScript Objects
A JavaScript object is an entity having properties and methods.Named values in JavaScript objects are called properties and methods are the actions that are performed by objects
objects are variables too but it contains many values.

Creating Objects in JavaScript,There are 3 ways to create  objects:

1. By using object literal.
2. By creating instance of object directly using new keyword.
3. By using an object constructor.

### Using an object literal:
By using an object literal ,we can define and create an object in one statement.

#### Syntax
```
object={property1:value1,property2:value2.....propertyN:valueN} 
```

### By creating instance of object:
Here new keyword, is used to create a object.

#### Syntax:
```
var objectname=new Object(); 
```

### By using an Object constructor:

Here, we need to create function with arguments. Each argument value can be assigned in the current object by using this keyword.
This keyword refers to the current object.
