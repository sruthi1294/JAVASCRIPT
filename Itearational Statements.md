## Iteration Statements:
Statements which are used to execute a set of statements repeatedly based on a condition are known as loop statements or iteration statements. 
JavaScript supports different kinds of loops:

I)for - loops through a block of code a number of times.
II)for/in - loops through the properties of an object.
III)while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.
IV)do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true.

### For Loop:
syntax:

for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) 
{
    //code block to be executed
}



###  For/In Loop:
The JavaScript for/in statement loops through the properties of an object:

Syantax:

for (x in person) 
{
      //code block to be executed
 }
         

###  While Loop:
The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
    code block to be executed
}


###  Do/While Loop:
The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

Syntax:
do {
    code block to be executed
}
while (condition);
