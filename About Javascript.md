## What is a JavaScript?

1. JavaScript is a scripting language primarily used on the web. This means that JavaScript code is written into an HTML page. 
2. When a user requests an HTML page with JavaScript in it, the script is sent to the browser and it's up to the browser to do something with it.

## Why Javascript?

1. JavaScript is a lightweight,high-level,dynamic and interpreted programming language.
2. JavaScript Can Change HTML Content,  HTML Attribute Values, HTML Styles (CSS) and also its Show and Hide HTML Elements.

## Advantages & Disadvantages of JavaScript?

### Advantages:
1. Being client-side, JavaScript is very fast because any code functions can be run immediately instead of having to contact the server and wait for an answer.
2. Simple to learn and implement.
3. It can also be used inside scripts written in other languages such as Perl and PHP.
4. Being client-side reduces the demand on the website server.

### Disadvantages:
1.The biggest disadvantages is code always visible to everyone anyone can view JavaScript code.
2. The code executes on the users computer, in some cases it can be exploited for malicious purposes. This is one reason some people choose to disable Javascript.

## Where Javascript is used?

1. The most common place to use it is in a web page.
2. To develop a Dynamic Websites we can definitely use the javascript because Dynamic websites contains forms,validation of fields,animations,etc.., and the web pages are 
   responsive,user interactive.
3. JavaScript adds behavior to the web page where the web page is capable of responding to actions by your visitors without needing to load a new web page in order to process 
   their request.
4. With JavaScript, you can validate each of the fields as they enter it and You can add animations into the page which either attract attention to a specific part of the page or which
   make the page easier to use.

## How Javascript is used in clinetside and serverside?

### Clientside:
1. JavaScript is the default scripting language in HTML.
2. We can write javascript in HTML document in 2 ways,one is Internal and another one is External.

 #### Internal Javascript: 
In HTML, JavaScript code must be inserted between <script> and </script> tags.You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
A JavaScript function is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for.For example, a function can be called when an event occurs, like when the user clicks 
a button.

#### External Javascript:
 External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages and the External javascript code files have the file extension .js.
 This file cannot contain <script> tags.To use an external script in HTML Document, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag,src value can be
 referenced with a full URL or with a path relative to the current web page.

### Serverside:
1. Server-side JavaScript (SSJS) refers to JavaScript that runs on server-side and is therefore not downloaded to the browser. With SSJS you write one piece of code that then gets
   used on both the server and the client. 
2. A user's request is fulfilled by running a script directly on the web server to generate dynamic HTML pages. This HTML is then sent to the client browser. 
3.  It is usually used to provide interactive web sites that interface to databases or other data stores on the server.For example,Node.js.
