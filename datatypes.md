## Datatypes 
The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:
I)String
II)Number
III)Boolean
IV)Array
V)Object 
VI) Undefined 
VII)Null
VIII)Symbol (new in ECMAScript 6) 

### Strings:
A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "Sruthi Nimmu".

### Numbers:
JavaScript has only one type of numbers.
Numbers can be written with, or without decimals.

### Booleans:
Booleans can only have two values: true or false.

 ### Arrays:
JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets.
Array items are separated by commas.

### Objects:
JavaScript objects are written with curly braces.
Object properties are written as name:value pairs, separated by commas.

### Undefined
In JavaScript, a variable without a value, has the value undefined. The typeof is also undefined.

### Null:

In JavaScript null is "nothing". It is supposed to be something that doesn't exist.
Unfortunately, in JavaScript, the data type of null is an object.

### Symbol(ES6):
The Symbol() function returns a value of type symbol, has static properties that expose several members of built-in objects,
 has static methods that expose the global symbol registry, and resembles a built-in object class but is incomplete 
as a constructor because it does not support the syntax "new Symbol()". 
Every symbol value returned from Symbol() is unique. 
The data type symbol is a primitive data type.

### ES7 datatypes

1.Array.prototype.includes:
The includes() method determines whether an array includes a certain element, returning true or false as appropriate.

2.Exponentiation infix operator
Math operations like addition and subtraction have infix operators like + and - , respectively. 
Similar to them, the ** infix operator is commonly used for exponent operation. In ECMAScript 2016, the ** was introduced instead of Math.pow .
